# DEC-AUP-0040 (KB-040). A canary result must be COMMITTED to be cashed (DEC-AUP-0037 R1) and a git
# commit cannot contain its own object id, so a subject pinned to the candidate head has no fixed
# point: every card measuring a canary-mandatory entity was condemned to paused_safe or to a
# hand-written exemption. The measured subject may therefore be an ANCESTOR of the candidate, on one
# condition that is provable from git objects alone: the whole delta between them is record
# documents. Then the code at the candidate is byte-for-byte the code the canary measured, which is
# the invariant — evidence about one tree must never vouch for a different tree's code.
#
# Deny-by-default. Widening this tuple widens what a measurement may skip over, and is a decision,
# not a patch: `receipts/` is where evidence and receipts live, `governance/design/` is the note a
# record commit writes beside them. Nothing executable and nothing policy-bearing is in here --
# `governance/decisions/`, `contracts/`, `tools/`, `.github/` are all outside it on purpose.

# A2-263 (KB-041). Two measured defects with one root: the gate resolved evidence through the
# FILESYSTEM and through the PRODUCER's absolute paths.
#
#  * `admit_change.canary_coverage` opened `output_ref` from the working tree. `.gitignore:15`
#    ignores `receipts/graph/verifier-out/**/graph-*.json`, and `impact.Repo.dirty()` is
#    `git status --porcelain`, which does not list ignored files. Measured on a clean checkout of
#    b8e298b9: a CanaryResult in NO commit credited `code_unit:apps/web/lib/api/tasks.ts` with full
#    coverage and zero problems while the worktree reported clean. CI's fresh checkout would not
#    have had the file; the LOCAL gate — the authoritative one under DEC-AUP-0007 — cashed it.
#  * A committed `CanaryResult/v2` resolved its plan and its source evidence relative to
#    `plan.path`, an absolute path on the machine that produced it. #119's canary therefore
#    verifies on this host only because `/home/dev/aup/arc2/runs/A2-247b/` still exists; with that
#    one directory hidden (private mount namespace, everything else identical) the same bytes at
#    the same commit yield 0 rows.
#
# The rule both halves now obey: an evidence document is read from GIT OBJECTS at the admitted
# head, and the documents it references are its SIBLINGS in the repository, named by basename. The
# reference's directory part is advisory and ignored; the bytes are pinned by digest either way
# (`plan.digest`, `subject.evidence.sha256`), so the basename decides only where to look, and the
# digest decides whether the right thing was found.
